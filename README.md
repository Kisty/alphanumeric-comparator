# An implementation of the Alphanum algorithm
 
The Alphanum Algorithm is an improved sorting algorithm for strings containing numbers.  
Instead of sorting numbers in ASCII order like a standard sort, this algorithm sorts numbers in numeric order.

The Alphanum Algorithm is discussed at http://www.DaveKoelle.com
